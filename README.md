Setup
---
1. Download or build.

2. Run and select the desired option:
    - Patch - replaces the `original_public_key` with the public key from the `private_key`
    - Unpatch - replaces the public key from the `private_key` with the `original_public_key`
    - Deauthorize - removes `Unlock.json` for the selected Live installation
    - Generate license - creates an authorize file using the `private_key` based on the provided HWID
    - Generate DSA key pair - generates a new custom DSA key pair that can be used to patch installations and generate licenses

The config file (`ableton-patcher-config.yml`) is not required for running but can be created manually, it accepts 2 options:

| Option                | Description                | Default                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `private_key`         | DER-encoded DSA key pair   | *R2R Team Key*              |
| `original_public_key` | DER-encoded DSA public key | *Original Ableton Live Key* |
